This PDF is an improved version of assignment 5. I explore various approaches to analyse semantic word relations using two web-based tools: Voyant and the Embedding Projector by TensorFlow. 
## Datasets
The two datasets here to be analysed are: 1) all tweets by Barack Obama posted between 2011-2016 and 2) all tweets posted by Donald Trump between 2011-2019.
## Questions
I Focus on a topic addressed by Trump and take note of the key terms associated with this topic. I identify the pattern in the use of those key terms and compare the word preferences between the two former presidents.
